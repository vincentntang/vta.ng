Hi, my name is Vincent Tang

I am a self-taught software developer based in Tampa, FL.

I am best known for creating [Tampa Devs](https://tampadevs.com)

Often times I will be asked where I get my inspiration when building things

The answer is pretty simple - I don't

I live life in the moment, and in that moment I will learn and try new things, and overtime I will find a community of people or lead one that fits
what I enjoy

In those moments, I will really deeply connect with someone

And there will be an origin story

That origin story is what drives me to build great things

A quote that I live by is this:

- It's the journey, not the destination
